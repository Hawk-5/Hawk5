A Qwerty Keyboard is displayed on the camera feed

An object has 2 surfaces - A marked fluorescent green colored surface to indicate start / trace and an unmarked surface of any other color

Identify if the marked fluorescent green colored surface is present on the Qwerty Keyboard, this triggers the start of the gesture

Once the marked fluorescent green colored surface is no longer visible, we conclude the gesture has come to an end

The co-ordinate points of the gesture are fed into the Shark2 Algorithm

The top 5 suggested words are displayed 

Identify the color of a particular object which is the pointer in our case
We find the region of an object having a specific color
Obtain the contour region of this object
Find the center of the colored region of this object
This approach is better than tracking as 

Now track this pointer as the gesture is being typed 
This can be done by keeping track of detected color point of previous frames in a queue.
This queue can be used to depict the gesture trail

Finding Stop and Start of the Gesture
When the contour is no more available. Ie the user hides the colored object, the gesture stops
The trace of the Gesture path is noted

Predicting the required word
The dictionary of words for the Shark2 algorithm are trained using the centroid points for each letter to obtain our template for gestures for each word.
The gesture trace of the user input is fed into the Shark2 Algorithm to predict the most suitable word
