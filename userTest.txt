A Qwerty Keyboard is displayed on the camera feed

An object has 2 surfaces - A marked fluorescent green colored surface to indicate start / trace and an unmarked surface of any other color

Identify if the marked fluorescent green colored surface is present on the Qwerty Keyboard, this triggers the start of the gesture

Once the marked fluorescent green colored surface is no longer visible, we conclude the gesture has come to an end

The co-ordinate points of the gesture are fed into the Shark2 Algorithm

The top 5 suggested words are displayed
